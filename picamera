Step 1: Installing the Camera module

On the Raspberry Pi, locate the Camera module port between the audio port and the HDMI port.
If you’re using Raspberry Pi B, it is between the Ethernet port and the HDMI port.
Insert the Camera module ribbon cable by gently pulling up the edges of the camera module port’s plastic chip.
When inserting the cable, make sure the blue side is faced to the Ethernet port, and the silver side is facing the HDMI port.

Then, push down the plastic chip into place.
Power on the Raspberry Pi.

=================
Step 2: Connecting the Camera module.

SSH to the Raspberry PI using its IP address and port 22
Enter the Username and password
Upgrade and Update the Pi. It’s a good practice to always update and upgrade the pi each time we use it. Enter sudo apt-get updateand sudo apt-get upgrade.
On the terminal, run sudo raspi-config.
Click on the Interface option.

Click on camera, then enable the camera interface.

Picamera configuring
Reboot the Raspberry Pi
Let’s take a still picture to be sure it working properly.

On the command-line (SSH), run raspistill -o Desktop/pic.jpg


The command raspistill is for taking still pictures. Since we are running the code from the terminal,
we can’t view the image captured. But we can use some software like VNC to view Raspberry’s desktop or send the file via command-line to your PC.

Here, we’ll use VNC to view the picture taken.

Output:


using VNC to display raspberry’s desktop

image captured using Picamera module
First, install the Picamera library on the Raspbian OS. Else, we’ll get an Import error: ‘no module named PiCamera’.

     sudo apt-get install python-picamera python3-picamera
Now, let’s write a python code that captures an image and sends a mail attaching the picture.

===========================================

Step 3: Python code

Create a python file send_image.py
Run     sudo nano send_image.py
Enter the following codes
